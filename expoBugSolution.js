The solution involves carefully managing the AGP version used during the Expo build.  One approach is to check the Expo documentation for compatibility information regarding the Android Gradle Plugin version. Ensure the `gradle.properties` file within the Android project folder (usually `android/gradle.properties`) reflects the correct AGP version compatible with your Expo SDK and dependencies.  Another solution may be updating dependencies to newer versions that support the latest AGP versions. It is also recommended to use the `--no-cache` option when building with Expo CLI. For more complex scenarios, manually specifying the AGP version in the `build.gradle` file may be necessary. Always consult Expo's documentation and community forums for the most up-to-date best practices.
